## What the Extension Does Access (Locally Only)

### 1. Current Tab URL  
Used solely to detect whether the website is likely to contain adult or gambling material.  
This information is **not stored, logged, or sent anywhere**.

The extension scans the page text **in memory only** to detect risky keywords.  
No content is ever saved or sent externally.

### 3. Minimal Local Settings  
The extension uses Chrome’s internal storage to keep:

- Your selected reminder mode: Neutral, Faith-Based, or Stoic  
- A small daily counter to avoid showing too many reminders  

This data is stored only on your device and never shared.
