# IMConscience – A Gentle Pause Before a Harmful Choice

IMConscience is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to help you **pause**, **breathe**, and **choose better** when visiting potentially harmful websites such as adult content pages or gambling platforms.

It does *not* block.  
It does *not* judge.  
It simply gives you back a moment of clarity before you act on impulse.

## 🌱 Why IMConscience Exists

Many harmful habits—whether involving adult content, gambling, overspending, or impulsive browsing—begin with a few seconds of automatic behavior.

IMConscience introduces a *soft pause* between your urge and your action, giving you the chance to reconnect with your goals, values, and future self.

A few seconds can change everything.  
This is your reminder.
